Images play an important role in any webpage. Though it is not recommended to include a lot of images, but it is still important to use good images wherever required.

CSS plays a good role to control image display. You can set the following image properties using CSS.

The border property is used to set the width of an image border.

The height property is used to set the height of an image.

The width property is used to set the width of an image.

The -moz-opacity property is used to set the opacity of an image.

The Image Border Property
The border property of an image is used to set the width of an image border. This property can have a value in length or in %.

A width of zero pixels means no border.



```
<html>
   <head>
   </head>

   <body>
      <img style = "border:0px;" src = "/css/images/logo.png" />
      <br />
      <img style = "border:3px dashed red;" src = "/css/images/logo.png" />
   </body>
</html> 
```


The Image Height Property
The height property of an image is used to set the height of an image. This property can have a value in length or in %. While giving value in %, it applies it in respect of the box in which an image is available.

Here is an example −

```
<html>
   <head>
   </head>

   <body>
      <img style = "border:1px solid red; height:100px;" src = "/css/images/logo.png" />
      <br />
      <img style = "border:1px solid red; height:50%;" src = "/css/images/logo.png" />
   </body>
</html> 
```



The Image Width Property
The width property of an image is used to set the width of an image. This property can have a value in length or in %. While giving value in %, it applies it in respect of the box in which an image is available.

Here is an example −

```
<html>
   <head>
   </head>

   <body>
      <img style = "border:1px solid red; width:150px;" src = "/css/images/logo.png" />
      <br />
      <img style = "border:1px solid red; width:100%;" src = "/css/images/logo.png" />
   </body>
</html> 
```



The -moz-opacity Property
The -moz-opacity property of an image is used to set the opacity of an image. This property is used to create a transparent image in Mozilla. IE uses filter:alpha(opacity=x) to create transparent images.

In Mozilla (-moz-opacity:x) x can be a value from 0.0 - 1.0. A lower value makes the element more transparent (The same things goes for the CSS3-valid syntax opacity:x).

In IE (filter:alpha(opacity=x)) x can be a value from 0 - 100. A lower value makes the element more transparent.

Here is an example −

```
<html>
   <head>
   </head>

   <body>
      <img style = "border:1px solid red; -moz-opacity:0.4; filter:alpha(opacity=40);" src = "/css/images/logo.png" />
   </body>
</html>
```
